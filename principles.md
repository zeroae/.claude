# Development Principles

Guidelines for AI assistants working on ZeroAE projects.

## Code Style

- Follow project-specific linting and formatting tools
- Use type hints where applicable (Python, TypeScript)
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add docstrings/comments only where logic isn't self-evident

## General Principles

1. **Simplicity over cleverness** - Prefer straightforward solutions
2. **YAGNI** - Don't add features or abstractions until needed
3. **Security awareness** - Watch for OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities
4. **Backwards compatibility** - Consider migration paths for breaking changes
5. **Test coverage** - Write tests for new features and bug fixes

## Project Structure

Individual projects may extend these guidelines with project-specific instructions in their own `CLAUDE.md` files.
